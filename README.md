Physicochemical patterns of residues in protein-proteins interfaces


Script desciptions:

calc_properties.py

This script enables to recaluclate the physicochemical patterning preferences for interfaces and non-interfaces for a given dataset. The input is a list of PDB id codes that will be automatically downloaded. The output is a flat file with rows summarizing how many properties of which type can be found around a given residue in a structure.

Dependencies:

python os, numpy, re

stride
